Future features

Prompts & Notes (for Siddique)
----------------------------
Sample prompts to use with the AI Helper (offline demo -> replace with LLM later):
- "Summarize OT for Production team"
- "Who has highest OT hours?"
- "Average OT hours per employee?"
- "Convert this message to professional English: 'ami kal chhuti nibo'"
- "Translate: 'Salary payment delayed' to Bangla"

Backend brief (how to connect)
------------------------------
1) Node.js + Express + MySQL:
   - Create REST endpoints: /api/attendance, /api/ot-report
   - Use mysql2 or Sequelize
   - Frontend: fetch('/api/ot-report?month=October&year=2025')

2) Firebase / Firestore:
   - Configure Firebase SDK in frontend or use callable cloud functions
   - Secure with Firebase Auth and Firestore rules

Deployment
----------
- GitHub Pages: push files to a repo and enable Pages (branch: main). Static site -> HTTPS provided.
- Vercel: connect repo and deploy (static). Auto HTTPS.

Files included & purpose
------------------------
- index.html: main single-page app
- style.css: styles
- script.js: app logic (localStorage demo)
- README.md: this file
- prompts_and_notes.txt: suggestions & future steps

Notes:
- The demo frontend stores attendance and messages in localStorage when no backend is configured.
- Replace APi endpoints and configure backend before sharing publicly.
